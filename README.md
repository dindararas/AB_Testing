# A/B Testing for Landing Page Designs

## üìã Project Overview
This project involves conducting an A/B test to compare three landing page designs - Vibrant, Heat, Cold - and determine which design performs better in terms of conversion rates. Beyond that, the analysis will consider other factors such as demographic and user behaviours. The insight will enhance marketing strategies, improve customer experience on the web/app, and boost speaker sales.

## ‚ùìBusiness Questions
Analysis and A/B testing try to answers business questions as follows.
1. Which design is more effective in converting into sign-up or purchase as well as improve customer engagement (duration and page views)?
2. Which channel contributes the most to the number of sessions and conversion?
3. When is the peak customer traffic on our website/app?
4. Which customer segments contribute the most to total sales and conversion rates?

## üìä Dataset Overview
Dataset for this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandeep1080/bassburst/data). This dataset contains website conversion data for bluetooth speaker sales with a total of 30,000 user sessions. The sessions are segmented by the landing page variant each user saw. The dataset also includes user-specific details, session engagement, product purchases, and payment methods, providing a comprehensive view of how website features and user characteristics influence conversions.
